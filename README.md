# tap_bot
The Code for a basic Discord Moderation Bot with some other fun functions fully written in python using discord.py.
I am planning to make a scripting ability within the bot to make basic bot scripting easier soon.
A second version of the bot will also be written in JavaScript along with some other laguages to make it more flexible.
